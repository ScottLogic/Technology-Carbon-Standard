Carbon emissions from the usage stage of the [product life cycle](/resources/glossary#product-life-cycle). This refers to the [greenhouse gas (GHG)](#greenhouse-gases-ghgs) emissions associated with the operation and use of a device or product throughout its entire life cycle, including the energy required to keep servers and devices running, and to transfer data from servers to the devices. 

Factors influencing usage carbon include the deviceâ€™s energy efficiency, usage patterns, life span, and the [carbon intensity](/resources/glossary#carbon-intensity) of the energy grid powering it.
