title: Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)
---

A methodology developed by the [Green Software Foundation](#green-software-foundation-gsf) to help calculate and track the impact of software, it is designed to be widely applicable and calculatable with a bias towards actions that eliminate carbon emissions. It considers both [operational](#operational-carbon) and [embodied carbon](#embodied-carbon) and has a scaling factor (R) that allows for a value that is independent of the size of the system which could be for example per transaction or per user. The inclusion of embodied carbon ensures that this value can never reach zero but gives a value that can be tracked to validate improvements over time.
