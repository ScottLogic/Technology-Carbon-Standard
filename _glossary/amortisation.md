title: Amortisation
---

When discussing [Embodied Carbon](#embodied-carbon), amortisation refers to dividing the total embodied carbon of a device by its expected lifespan. This gives a way of accounting for the emissions a device on a yearly basis. For example; A [2023 Apple 16" Macbook Pro has an embodied carbon of 290kg CO2e](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/notebooks/16-inch_MacBook_Pro_PER_Oct2023.pdf) with a life cycle of four years gives an amortisation of:

<div>
$$ Amortisation = \frac{290\ kg\ CO2e}{4\ years} = 72.5\ kg\ CO2e/year $$
</div>

Extending the life of a device, i.e. using it beyond its expected life cycle can have a significant impact on the amortised emissions. If that Macbook's life cycle was extended to 6 years before being scrapped (and ideally recycled), the amortisation can be re-calculated as:

<div>
$$ Amortisation = \frac{290\ kg\ CO2e}{6\ years} = 48.3\ kg\ CO2e/year $$
</div>

A saving of over 24kg CO2e per year is possible by extending the life of the MacBook to six years.
