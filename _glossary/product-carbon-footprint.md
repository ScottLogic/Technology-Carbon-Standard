title: Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)
---

A method used to assess the climate impact of a product through the measurement of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted throughout its [product life cycle](/resources/glossary#product-life-cycle). GHGs are translated into carbon equivalents (CO2e) for comparison purposes.

The evaluation of a product's carbon footprint typically involves conducting a [Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)](/resources/glossary#life-cycle-assessment-lca) to assess the environmental impacts associated with all stages of the product's life. The difference is that a full LCA looks at wider environmental impacts (such as land use, water consumption) whereas PCF focuses on the environmental impacts due to GHG emissions.
