title: Power Purchase Agreements (PPA)
---

A long-term contract for the sale of electricity generated from renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or hydropower. PPAs provide the developer with a guaranteed revenue stream to finance projects, and allow the purchaser to secure renewable energy at a fixed price for many years. This also provides the purchaser with [RECs](#renewable-energy-certificates-recs) that cover the energy purchased.

PPAs are critical for financing new renewable energy projects and encourage additionality in terms of increasing the renewable energy provided to the grid. The purchaser will likely still receive power from the grid or at least rely on it during periods where renewable sources are limited.
