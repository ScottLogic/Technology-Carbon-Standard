Blue Water (BW) refers to freshwater originating from rivers, lakes reservoirs and aquifers. It is used for many purposes, including agricultural, industrial, and domestic. 

It is worth emphasising that most of AI's water footprint comes from blue water, which is directly accessible for human use but often more limited in availability.
