title: Product Life Cycle
---

Refers to all of the aspects that contribute to the environmental impact of a device. This includes:

- Raw material extraction
- Production
- Packaging
- Usage
- End-of-life treatment

Aspects like usage will need to take into account the expected life span of the device, its typical use patterns, and the [carbon intensity](#carbon-intensity) of the energy used to power the device.

The environmental impacts of a product or device throughout its product life cycle can be assessed by considering its [Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)](/resources/glossary#life-cycle-assessment-lca) or [Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)](/resources/glossary#product-carbon-footprint-pcf).
