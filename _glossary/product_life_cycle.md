title: Product Life Cycle
---

Refers to all of the aspects that contribute to the environmental impact of a device. This includes:

- Raw material extraction
- Production
- Packaging
- Usage
- End-of-life treatment

Aspects like usage will need to take into account the expected life span of the device, its typical use patterns and the [Carbon Intensity](#carbon-intensity) of the energy used to power the device.

Environmental impacts can be assessed through methodologies such as [Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)](/glossary#life-cycle-assessment-lca). Specifically, climate impacts of a device can be 

The environmental impacts of a product or device throughout its product life cycle can be assessed by considering its [Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)](/glossary#life-cycle-assessment-lca) or the [Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)](/glossary#product-carbon-footprint-pcf).
