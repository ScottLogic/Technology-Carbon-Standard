title: Attribution Factor
---

The proportion of an emission that is attributable in some circumstance, typically expressed as a percentage. It is used discretionally to calculate that value.

A common example of its use might be in a "bring your own device" policy: if a laptop is provided by a worker and used during a working week for work but outside that time for other purposes, the attribution factor for its emissions would represent the proportion of time it is used for work.
