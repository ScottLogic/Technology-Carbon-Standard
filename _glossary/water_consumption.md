title: Water Consumption
---

Water withdrawal, or water intake, refers to the total volume water withdrawn from its original source. 

Water consumption by contrast is the portion of withdrawn water that is not being returned to its original source, as a result of evaporation, evapotranspiration, product or crop integration, water transfers to different watersheds, consumption or otherwise removed from freshwater resources.

The difference between water withdrawal and water discharge is the amount consumed.

To accurately assess water stress and water scarcity, it is essential to measure both water use (withdrawal) and water consumption.
