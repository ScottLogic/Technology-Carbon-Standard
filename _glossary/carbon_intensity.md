title: Carbon Intensity
---

The amount of carbon emitted per unit of electrical energy of a country/region's grid. This varies not only with geographical location but also with time as it depends on the proportion of renewable energy sources which have highly variable output depending on the wind/waves/sun/rainfall at any point in time. There are two methodologies for calculating this:

### Location Based
This method only considers the carbon intensity of the local grid and ignores the electricity mix purchased from suppliers.

### Market Based
This method considers the electricity you have purchased from your suppliers which could be green energy tariffs that leverage Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) and Guarantees of Origin (REGO) allowing benefits in reporting for companies that source their electricity more sustainably.
