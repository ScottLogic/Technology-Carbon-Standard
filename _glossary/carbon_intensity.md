title: Carbon Intensity
---

The amount of carbon emitted per unit of electrical energy of a country/region's grid. This varies not only with geographical location but also with time as it depends on the proportion of renewable energy sources which have highly variable output depending on the wind/waves/sun/rainfall at any point in time. There are two methodologies for calculating this:

### Location Based
This method only considers the carbon intensity of the local grid and ignores the electricity mix purchased from suppliers. These figures can be obtained from [Ember Data Explorer](https://ember-climate.org/data/data-tools/data-explorer/); some examples are shown below:

| Region             | Carbon Intensity (gCO2e/kWh)   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Global             | 494                            |
| Europe             | 330                            |
| Germany            | 372                            |
| UK                 | 238                            |
| France             | 56                             |

*Global and European values are based on 2022 data, other locations are based on 2023 data. Source: Ember Data Explorer*


### Market Based
This method considers the electricity you have purchased from your suppliers which could be green energy tariffs that leverage [Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)](#renewable-energy-certificates-recs) and Guarantees of Origin (REGO) allowing benefits in reporting for companies that source their electricity more sustainably.
