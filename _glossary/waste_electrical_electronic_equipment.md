title: Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)
---

Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) refers to discarded electronic devices that have reached end-of-life (EOL). This includes used electronics destined for reuse, resale, recycling, or disposal.

The proliferation of electronic goods and short innovation cycles has led to a global e-waste problem. Electronic scrap components, such as CPUs, contain potentially harmful materials such as lead, cadmium, beryllium, or brominated flame retardants. Improper handling during recycling and disposal carries environmental and human health risks.

Rapid technological advancement and consumption continues to fuel rising e-waste volumes globally. The EU WEEE Directive is a policy effort aimed at regulating and mitigating this electronic waste stream through treatment, recovery, and responsible disposal requirements for certain electronic goods.
