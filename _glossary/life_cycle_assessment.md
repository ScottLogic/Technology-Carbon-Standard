title: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
---

A method used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product or system by looking at its entire [product life cycle](/glossary#product-life-cycle), considering a variety of environmental impacts such as climate change, water consumption, land use, and health factors. 

An LCA considers a broad range of environmental impacts of a product. This is different to the calculation of a [Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)](/glossary#product-carbon-footprint-pcf) which assesses only the climate impact (environmental impacts due to GHG emissions).
