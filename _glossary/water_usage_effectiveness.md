title: Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) 
---

A metric used to measure how efficiently data centres use water for cooling and operations. WUE is quantified in cubic meters per megawatt hour of energy (m3/MWh), representing the amount of water consumed per unit of IT equipment output or computing work.
To better understand the true water cost of data centres, source (offsite) and site-based (onsite) WUE metrics must be accounted for.
[The Green Grid](https://airatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Green-Grid-White-Paper-35-WUE-Usage-Guidelines.pdf) distinguishes them as:

- **WUE**: a site-based metric that is an assessment of the water used on-site for operation of the data
center. This includes water used for humidification and water evaporated on-site for energy production
or cooling of the data center and its support systems (similar to carbon Scope 1).
- **WUEsource**: a source-based metric that includes water used on-site and water used off-site in the
production of the energy used on-site. Typically this adds the water used at the power-generation
source to the water used on-site (similar to carbon Scope 2).
