title: Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)
---

A metric used to measure how efficiently data centres use water for cooling and operations. WUE is quantified in cubic meters per megawatt hour of energy (m3/MWh), representing the amount of water consumed per unit of IT equipment output or computing work.
To better understand the true water cost of data centres, source (offsite) and site-based (onsite) WUE metrics must be accounted for.
[The Green Grid](https://airatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Green-Grid-White-Paper-35-WUE-Usage-Guidelines.pdf) distinguishes them as WUE and ([WUE_source](/resources/glossary#water-usage-effectiveness-source-wue-source)).
