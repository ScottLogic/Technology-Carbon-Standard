An emerging sustainable design principle for software. Because [carbon intensity](#carbon-intensity) fluctuates with time and region you can design software that measures and/or predicts when and where the electricity grid is cleanest and can schedule time-insensitive tasks to run during these periods. Think of overnight backups, batch sending of newsletters or training of ML models. These can be delayed a few hours and not harm or delay the delivery or promotion of new products.
