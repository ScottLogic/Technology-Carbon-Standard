title: Embodied Carbon
---

The emissions associated with the manufacture, transportation, installation, maintenance, and end-of-life of a device or product.

Embodied carbon emissions often contribute a larger portion of the total emissions in the technology industry compared to other sectors. These emissions are more challenging to quantify as they are indirect and typically require businesses to interact with suppliers and retrieve emissions data for the purchased products, such as [Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)](/resources/glossary#product-carbon-footprint-pcf) data. Although the availability of such data is becoming more widespread, there is currently no standardised way to access this information for all products.
