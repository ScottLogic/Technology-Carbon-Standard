title: Embodied Carbon
---

The CO2 emitted from all processes that are not directly related to operations and keeping the software up and running. This includes the manufacturing and transporting of hardware and the planning, designing and maintaining of the software. Embodied emissions often take up a larger portion of the total emissions in software compared to other sectors. These emissions are much harder to quantify as they are indirect and usually require business to interact and retrieve emissions data on purchased products. While it is becoming more common for this data to be available, there is not a common way to access this data for all hardware.
