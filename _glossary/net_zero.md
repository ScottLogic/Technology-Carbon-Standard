A standard designed by [The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) which takes carbon neutrality to the next level by ensuring businesses reduce their emission by 90% by only allowing them to offset a maximum of 10% of their emissions. It can be applied to CO2 only or to all GHGs.
