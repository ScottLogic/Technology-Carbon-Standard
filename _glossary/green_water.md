title: Green Water

Green Water (GW) refers to water accessible to plants and microorganisms. It comes from precipitation, which infiltrates and is stored in the soil and can only be used in situ by plants. The main process through which green water moves is "evapotranspiration", where it evaporates from soil into the atmosphere.
