The [Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/) is a globally recognised accounting tool for governments and businesses to understand, quantify, and manage their greenhouse gas emissions. The protocol defines three scopes of emissions:

### Scope 1
Scope 1 emissions encompass the direct greenhouse gas (GHG) releases from resources a company owns and controls. These emissions enter the atmosphere as an immediate consequence of the company's operations. It's important to note that all fuel consumption resulting in GHG emissions must be accounted for within Scope 1. Scope 1 is categorised into four main areas:
- Stationary combustion; such as fuels and heating sources.
- Mobile combustion; from all fuel burning company owned or controlled vehicles.
- Fugitive emissions; from leaked refridgeration and air conditioning units.
- Process emissions; released during manufacturing and industrial processes.

### Scope 2
Scope 2 includes all indirect emissions from the generation of energy purchased by an organisation. The most common is electricity consumption used by equipment, lighting, heating and cooling. The [GHG Corporate Standard](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf) recommends multiplying electricity consumption by the supplier specific emissions factor ([carbon intensity](#carbon-intensity)) to calculate the GHG emissions impact. If the details about the electricity supply are unavailable, it is recommended to use the regional grid carbon intensity.

Scope 1 and 2 reporting is required for GHG accounting. Importantly, Scope 1 and 2 definitions do not allow for double counting.

### Scope 3
Scope 3 includes all indirect emissions that occur in an organisationâ€™s value chain, both upstream and downstream. The GHG Protocol seperates Scope 3 into 15 categories, including business travel, waste disposal and purchased goods and services.

Scope 3 emissions often represent the largest portion of a company's total GHG emissions, sometimes accounting for more than 70% of the carbon footprint. Therefore, while it may be optional in some contexts, reporting Scope 3 emissions is increasingly seen as crucial for understanding and managing a company's full climate impact.

Unlike scope 1 and 2, scope 3 can be double counted. For example, the manufacture of a product would be accounted for within the manufacturer's scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. A company purchasing that product would report and count the emissions of that product's manufacture and transport in their own Scope 3 emissions, accounting for those emissions a second time. This double counting can only occur within a company's scope 3 emissions.
