title: Typical Energy Consumption (TEC)
---

A method of comparing the energy performance of devices. TEC refers to the typical or average amount of energy consumed by a device while performing a typical workload over a certain time period (i.e. the energy consumption associated with standard household usage). It is expressed in units of kWh per year. Amongst similar devices, a lower TEC usually indicates more efficient energy usage. It is based on standard assumptions about the time spent in different usage modes (off, idle, max) and gives a more real-world metric compared to peak power ratings.

TEC is often used in Energy Star specifications and efficiency standards for servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and other data centre hardware. Manufacturers may be required to publicly disclose TEC ratings to sell certain products.
