CO2 emissions due to the operational phase of software, this phase includes the hosting and use of software. So sources of emissions include the energy needed to keep your servers on, energy needed to keep end user devices running and energy needed to transfer data from your server to the end userâ€™s device. The energy used can be transformed into CO2e emissions by taking into account the [Carbon Intensity](#carbon-intensity) at the time and place the energy was used.
