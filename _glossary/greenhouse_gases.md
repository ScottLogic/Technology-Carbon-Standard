title: Greehouse Gases (GHGs)
---

These are gases that amplify the greenhouse effect, the effect caused by trapping energy from the sun within the Earth's atmosphere. Examples are the well known Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emitted from electricity generation and other lesser known gases like Methane (CH4) sourced from office catering production and disposal and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) used in office cooling systems.
