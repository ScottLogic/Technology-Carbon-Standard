title: Fossil Fuel
---

A natural fuel that is formed by the remains of animals or plants that lived in the past. This fuel is not quickly produced, much slower than the rate of extraction, and the burning of them results in the re-emission of carbon that was stored within the remains of the organisms leading to [GHG](#greenhouse-gases-ghgs) accumulation in the atmosphere. These two points make this type of fuel non-renewable and unsustainable. Examples include coal, oil and gas.
