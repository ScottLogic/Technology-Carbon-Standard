title: Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2e)
---

As a way of quantifying the effect of all [GHG](#greenhouse-gases-ghgs) emissions emitted CO2 is used as the baseline. Some GHGs are more potent and others are less. For example R-410A, one of the most common refrigerants used in AC units, is 2,088 more potent than CO2 therefore a leak of 1 kg of R22 is the same as a 2 tonne leak of CO2.
