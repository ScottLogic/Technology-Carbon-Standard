# Technology-Carbon-Standard
This is the repository for the Technology Carbon Standard Website available at: [www.techcarbonstandard.org](http://www.techcarbonstandard.org/) created by Scott Logic Ltd.

A proposed Technology Carbon Standard that aims to provide a unified standard for understanding, quantifying, and reducing carbon emissions from an organisation's technology landscape. A component of a holistic Technology Sustainability Framework (that covers more sustainability considerations).


## Running a Local Environment

Setting up your local environment you will need to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en). Once installed run the following commands to install the project dependencies: ```npm install``` and  ```bundle install```.

To run a local environment use: 
```bundle exec jekyll serve```. This will start a local server running the website on http://localhost:4000/.

Add `--livereload` to live reload the page on file save.
