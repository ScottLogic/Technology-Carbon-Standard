# Downstream Emissions

Downstream emissions (Category D) are the emissions produced by using an organisation’s products and/or services. This could be B2B or B2C users of the products and services. The emissions are attributed to the end-user’s device energy use and the transmission of data to use that product or service.

## End-User Devices

This considers the emissions generated from the electricity consumption of devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones that utilise the software or services provided by the organisation. It is important to account for the differences in energy efficiency across various devices accessing the services. Typically, a smartphone uses less energy than a laptop, and a laptop uses less energy than a desktop. It is recommended to factor in the average length of use cycles of devices, before their replacement with new ones, when estimating the embodied carbon of end-user devices in downstream emissions.

## Network Data Transfer

These emissions are associated with the infrastructure enabling data transmission, enabling end-users to access the products and services. Network emissions can be estimated based on the size of the data transferred, the distance transmitted, and the carbon intensity of the regions through which the data is transferred.

Tracking the multiple components related to end-users' usage and access to digital solutions across various hardware and networks represents the complex downstream component of technology carbon accounting.

Downstream emissions are related to GHG Protocol Scope 3.
