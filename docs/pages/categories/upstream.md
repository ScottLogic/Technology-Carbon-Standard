# Upstream Emissions

Upstream emissions (Category U) are the emissions associated with two areas:
- the embodied carbon from the production, transport and installation of hardware and equipment. This includes items such as:
  - employee equipment including laptops, phones and printers.
  - networking hardware installed within an organisation's premises, including routers, access points and switches.
  - on-premise data centers, servers and data storage devices.
- the carbon emissions associated with the development and distribution of commercial off the shelf software (COTS).

The upstream emissions can be estimated by accounting for the organisation's technolgy assets, and refering to the product life cycle data sheets that most manufacturers provide.
