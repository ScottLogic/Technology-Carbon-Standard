# Operational Emissions

Operational emissions are the emissions generated from the organisation's tech operations. This is segmented in to three categories; O, C and G and, organised by emissions that are **directly** and **indirectly** attributed to the organisation.

## Direct Emissions
Direct emissions are those generated by the organisation where it is *directly* consuming energy (from the energy grid; category O) and /or fuel (generators, solar, wind, etc to generate electrictiy; category G) to power the technology. That includes equipment such as:
- servers and storage devices
- networking equipment
- employee devices (laptops, monitors, phones etc)

## Indirect Emissions
Indirect emissions are those emissions generated by third party service providers, whose servcies are used by the organisation. Services such as:
- Cloud Services
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Managed Services

The emissions from these services cannot be *directly* measured by the organisation, but the use of those services certainly comes with a carbon cost.
