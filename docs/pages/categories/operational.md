# Operational Emissions
Operational emissions encompass the greenhouse gases emitted from an organisation's own technology infrastructure and operations. These are categorised into three groups - On-Prem, Cloud, and Generator emissions (O, C and G) - based on the level of ownership and control an organisation has over the assets.

Emissions are further classified into direct and indirect sources:

## Direct Emissions
Direct emissions refer to emissions from assets owned and controlled by the organisation, (on-premise). This includes:

- On-premise servers, data centers, networking equipment, computers, laptops, monitors and other devices used by employees.
- Any fossil fuel-powered generators, solar PV, wind turbines or other systems installed on-site to supply electricity to technology equipment.

Direct emissions are a result of the organisation's direct consumption of grid-supplied electricity (Category O) or combustion of fossil fuels like diesel or natural gas for owned power generators (Category G). The organisation can directly measure and account for emissions from owned assets.

Category O (On-premise) emissions can be related to GHG Protocol Scope 2, while Category G (Generators) are GHG Protocol Scope 1.

## Indirect Emissions
Indirect emissions result from the organisation's purchase of cloud computing services, software or managed IT services from third-party technology providers. Examples include:

- Cloud platform services like compute, storage, networking.
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications.
- Managed Security Operations, IT support and data backup services.

As the organisation does not own or control the IT assets delivering these services, their associated emissions cannot be directly quantified. But use of these services contributes substantially to the organisation's overall technology emissions footprint. These are relatable to GHG Protocol Scope 3.

Emissions estimates for third-party services can be obtained from providers to account for these indirect, supply chain impacts.
