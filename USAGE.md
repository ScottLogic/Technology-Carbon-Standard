# Tech Carbon Standard (TCS) Usage Guidelines

## License

The Tech Carbon Standard (TCS) is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike-NonCommercial (CC BY-SA-NC) license. The full text of this license can be found in the LICENSE file in this repository.

## Intended Use

Scott Logic has chosen the CC BY-SA-NC license for the Tech Carbon Standard (TCS) to promote wide adoption while maintaining certain restrictions on commercial use. To clarify our intentions:

1. **Internal Use by Commercial Organizations**: Commercial organizations are free to use the TCS internally for their own carbon accounting and sustainability efforts. This includes adapting the standard for internal use, sharing it within the organization, and using it to guide decision-making and reporting.

2. **Non-Commercial Use**: In line with the CC BY-SA-NC license, any non-commercial use of the TCS is permitted, provided that proper attribution is given and any derivative works are shared under the same license terms.

3. **Selling Services Based on TCS**: The sale of services that are primarily based on or incorporate the TCS requires a separate license agreement with Scott Logic. This includes, but is not limited to, consulting services, software products, or training programs that substantially leverage the TCS.

4. **Contributions and Derivative Works**: We encourage contributions to the TCS. Any modifications or derivative works must be shared under the same CC BY-SA-NC license, in accordance with the ShareAlike clause.
