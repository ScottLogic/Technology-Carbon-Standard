  <h1>Technology Carbon Standard</h1>

  <p>The Technology Carbon Standard aims to provide a unified standard for understanding, quantifying, and reducing carbon emissions from an organisation's technology landscape. Outlining a standardised methodology for attributing emissions to different aspects of the tech estate enables organisations to identify priority areas and opportunities to mitigate emissions effectively.</p>

  <p>The standard categorises emissions into three key areas:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li><strong>Upstream Emissions</strong>: Emissions relating to the production of hardware and the installed software used by the organisation.</li>

    <li><strong>Operational Emissions</strong>: Emissions from the day-to-day running of the organisation's IT infrastructure and services. This encompasses emissions from powering devices, data centers, servers, and cloud services.</li>

    <li><strong>Downstream Emissions</strong>: Emissions arising from customers' use of the organisation's technology outputs and services, such as its public websites and apps.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This framework provides comprehensive coverage of an organisation's technology carbon footprint while clarifying the different sources of emissions. Improving quantification and transparency aims to spur more targeted, impactful efforts to reduce IT-related emissions.</p>
