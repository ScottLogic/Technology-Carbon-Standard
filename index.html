<h1>Technology Carbon Standard <small>(Proposed)</small></h1>

<div>
  <p>Introducing a proposed Technology Carbon Standard for analysing an organisation's Technology Carbon Footprint.</p>

  <p>This is developed as an approach to classifying an organisation's technology estate to enable consistent analysis and benchmarking of its technology carbon footprint. This standard takes inspiration from the globally recognised GHG Protocol and its emissions classification into Scopes 1, 2, and 3.</p>

  <h2>Why a New Standard?</h2>

  <p>The goal of this Technology Carbon Standard is to provide a standardised method for organisations to map, measure, and mitigate the environmental impacts of their technology. This fills a gap between high-level consultancy guidance and specific projects tackling individual areas like cloud computing. Consistent standards facilitate productive conversations between sustainability stakeholders, technology leadership and practitioners.</p>

  <p>By delineating an organisation's technology estate into categories analogous to GHG Protocol scopes, technology practitioners can more easily identify the most carbon-intensive areas to prioritise for impact reduction. This is not intended to reinvent existing efforts in sustainability measurement and reporting. Where relevant, the methodology references and integrates with established open-source initiatives for calculating technology emissions.</p>

<div>
  <p>The standard categorises emissions into three key areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/categories/upstream">Upstream Emissions</a>: Emissions relating to the embodied carbon of hardware and the carbon emissions of the development and distribution of installed software used by the organisation.</li>
    <li><a href="categories/operational">Operational Emissions</a>: Emissions from the day-to-day running of the organisation's IT infrastructure and services. This encompasses emissions from powering devices, data centers, servers, and cloud services.</li>
    <li><a href="categories/downstream">Downstream Emissions</a>: Emissions arising from customers' use of the organisation's technology outputs and services, such as its public websites and apps.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that the Tech Carbon Standard does not include other aspects of an organisation's carbon footprint. For example, People, Buildings and Travel (i.e. commuting) are not included in the standard.</p>
  <p>This standard provides comprehensive coverage of an organisation's technology carbon footprint while clarifying the different sources of emissions. Improving quantification and transparency aims to spur more targeted, impactful efforts to reduce tech-related emissions.</p>
