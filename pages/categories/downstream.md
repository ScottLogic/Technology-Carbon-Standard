# Downstream Emissions

Downstream emissions (Category D) are the emissions produced by using an organisation’s products and/or services. This could be B2B or B2C users of the products and services. The emissions are attributed to the end-user’s device energy use and the transmission of data to use that product or service.

Downstream emissions are related to GHG Protocol Scope 3.

This considers the emissions generated from the electricity consumption of devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones that utilise the products or services provided by the organisation. 

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Network Data Transfer" level=2 %}

These emissions are associated with the infrastructure enabling data transmission, enabling end-users to access the products and services. Network emissions can be estimated based on the size of the data transferred, the distance transmitted, and the carbon intensity of the regions through which the data is transferred.
