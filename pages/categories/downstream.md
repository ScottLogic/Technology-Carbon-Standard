# Downstream Emissions

Downstream emissions (Category D) are the emissions produced by using an organisation’s products and/or services. This could be B2B or B2C users of the products and services. The emissions are attributed to the end-user’s device energy use and the transmission of data to use that product or service.

Downstream emissions are related to GHG Protocol Scope 3.

This considers the emissions generated from the electricity consumption of devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones that utilise the products or services provided by an organisation. It is important to account for the differences in energy efficiency across various devices accessing these products and services. Typically, a smartphone uses less energy than a laptop, and a laptop uses less energy than a desktop. Understanding the [energy use of devices](/information/lifecycle/usage) can then be used to estimate carbon emissions by considering the source of the energy ([Carbon Intensity](/glossary#carbon-intensity)) used to power or charge that device. Finally, end-user devices should have their embodied carbon estimated. This should take into account the product’s life span to consider the entire [Product Life Cycle](/glossary#product-life-cycle). [Read more about hardware lifecycle emissions](/information/lifecycle).

These emissions are associated with the infrastructure enabling data transmission, enabling end-users to access the products and services. Network emissions can be estimated based on the size of the data transferred, the distance transmitted, and the carbon intensity of the regions through which the data is transferred.
