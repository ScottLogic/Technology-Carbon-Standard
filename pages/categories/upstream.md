# Upstream Emissions

Upstream emissions (Category U) refer to the emissions that occur in the production and distribution stages of technology products and software purchased by an organisation.

To quantify upstream emissions, the technology purchase categories are mapped with life cycle emissions data for each product class published by reputable manufacturers and software vendors. This lifecycle data encompasses resource extraction, materials processing, manufacturing, transportation and product delivery phases before the operation stage.

Multiplying the volume of assets by the respective product emission factors can yield an accurate upstream emissions profile. The product emission factors are available in Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) and sustainability reports.

Upstream emissions are related to GHG Protocol Scope 3.
