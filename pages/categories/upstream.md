# Upstream Emissions

Upstream emissions (Category U) refer to the emissions that occur in the production and distribution stages of technology products and software purchased by an organisation. This encompasses:

## Hardware Equipment Production
Emissions from manufacturing, transport, and installation of all the hardware equipment used within the organisation's technology infrastructure. This spans employee devices, networking gear, and on-premise data centers:

- Laptops, desktops, mobiles, printers and peripherals used by employees
- Network routers, switches, wifi access points installed
- Servers, storage systems and data center infrastructure installed on-premise

## Software Development & Distribution
Emissions associated with developing and delivering commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software installed on the organisation's systems. Includes emissions related to:

- Programming, testing and releasing new software versions purchased
- Packaging and digital distribution of software over the internet
- Product support services for troubleshooting and guiding customers

To quantify upstream emissions, the technology purchase categories are mapped with life cycle emissions data for each product class published by reputable manufacturers and software vendors. This lifecycle data encompasses resource extraction, materials processing, manufacturing, transportation and product delivery phases before the operation stage.

Multiplying the volume of assets by the respective product emission factors can yield an accurate upstream emissions profile. The product emission factors are available in Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) and sustainability reports.

Upstream emissions are related to GHG Protocol Scope 3.
