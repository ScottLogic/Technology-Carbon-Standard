# Operational Emissions
Operational emissions encompass the greenhouse gases emitted from an organisation's own technology infrastructure and operations. These are categorised into three groups - On-Prem, Cloud, and Generator emissions (O, C, and G) - based on the level of ownership and control an organisation has over the assets.

Understanding operational emissions allows organisations to quantify, monitor, and benchmark the climate impacts of their technology infrastructure and business operations. It enables setting emission reduction targets and strategies and facilitates compliance with current and emerging climate disclosure legislations. 

Emissions are further classified into direct and indirect sources:

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Direct Emissions" level=2 %}

Direct emissions are a result of the organisation's direct consumption of grid-supplied electricity (Category O) or combustion of fossil fuels like diesel or natural gas for owned power generators (Category G). The organisation can directly measure and account for emissions from owned assets.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="On-premise" level=3 %}

Emissions associated with the actual operation and use of devices owned by an organisation ([usage carbon](/glossary#usage-carbon)).

Category O (On-premise) emissions can be related to GHG Protocol Scope 2.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Servers and Storage" level=4 %}

The energy consumed by on-premise servers and data centres.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Networking Devices" level=4 %}

The energy consumed by networking devices such as routers, switches, and Wi-Fi access points. 

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Employee Devices" level=4 %}

The energy consumed by computers (desktops, laptops), monitors, printers, and other devices used by employees.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Generators" level=3 %}

Any fossil fuel-powered generators, solar PV, wind turbines, or other systems installed on-site to supply electricity to technology equipment.

Category G (Generators) can be related to GHG Protocol Scope 1.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Indirect Emissions" level=2 %}
Indirect emissions result from the organisation's purchase of cloud computing services, software, or managed IT services from third-party technology providers.

As the organisation does not own or control the IT assets delivering these services, their associated emissions cannot be directly quantified. But use of these services contributes substantially to the organisation's overall technology emissions footprint. These are relatable to GHG Protocol Scope 3.

Emissions estimates for third-party services can be obtained from providers to account for these indirect, supply chain impacts.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Cloud Services" level=3 %}

The emissions associated with cloud platform services like compute, storage, and networking. Services are backed by computing hardware with associated upstream and operational emissions. The proportion of such emissions attributable to an organisation will vary based on service, server instance types, and region.
