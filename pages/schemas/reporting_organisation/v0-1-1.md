# Reporting Organisation Schema v0.1.1

The Reporting Organisation Schema defines the root structure for Technology Carbon Standard documents, including organisation details and the collection of emissions reports over time.

## Purpose

The Reporting Organisation Schema provides:

- **Organisational Context:** Captures essential information about the reporting entity
- **Report Collection:** Manages multiple emissions reports with different schema versions
- **Flexibility:** Allows each emissions report to use different schema versions as standards evolve
- **Identification:** Links organisations to external registries like Open Corporates


## Schema Information

- **Schema ID:** [https://techcarbonstandard.org/schemas/reporting_organisation/v0.1.1.json](/schemas/reporting_organisation/v0.1.1.json)
- **Version:** 0.1.1
- **Parent Schema:** Referenced by Router Schema for version 0.1.1
- **Child Schemas:** References Emissions Report schemas


## Schema Structure

```json
{
  "schema_version": "0.1.1",
  "organisation": {
    "organisation_name": "Example Corp",
    "description": "Description of the organisation",
    "open_corporates_url": "https://opencorporates.com/companies/gb/12345678",
    "registered_country": "England"
  },
  "emissions_reports": [
    {
      "schema_version": "0.0.2",
      // Emissions report content validated against v0.0.2 schema
    }
  ]
}
```

## Root Level Fields

### Schema Version (required)

Specifies the version of the Reporting Organisation Schema being used:

```json
"schema_version": "0.1.1"
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| schema_version | string (enum) | Yes | Must be "0.1.1" for this schema version |


### Organisation (required)

Contains information about the reporting organisation:

```json
"organisation": {
  "organisation_name": "Example Corp",
  "description": "Software consultancy specialising in complex applications",
  "open_corporates_url": "https://opencorporates.com/companies/gb/12345678",
  "registered_country": "England"
}
```

#### Organisation Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| organisation_name | string | Yes | Name of the reporting organisation |
| description | string | No | Description of the reporting organisation |
| open_corporates_url | string (URI) | No | Open Corporates URL for the reporting organisation |
| registered_country | string | No | Country of registration of the reporting organisation |

### Emissions Reports (required)

An array containing one or more emissions reports. Each report can use a different schema version:

```json
"emissions_reports": [
  {
    "schema_version": "0.0.2",
    "reporting_period": {
      "from_date": "2023-01-01",
      "to_date": "2023-12-31"
    },
    "verification": "self reported",
    "tech_carbon_standard": {
      "schema_version": "0.0.2"
    }
  }
]
```

#### Emissions Report Versioning

Each emissions report specifies its own schema version, allowing organisations to:

- **Migrate Gradually**: Use newer schema versions for new reports while maintaining historical data
- **Mix Versions**: Have reports from different time periods using different schema versions
- **Future-Proof**: Adopt new schema features as they become available

Currently supported emissions report schema versions:
- `"0.0.2"` - [Emissions Report schema v0.0.2](/schemas/emissions-report/v0-0-2)
- `"0.0.1"` - [Emissions Report schema v0.0.1](/schemas/emissions-report/v0-0-1)


## Validation Rules

### Required Fields
- Root level `schema_version` must be `"0.1.1"`
- `organisation` object is required
- `organisation.organisation_name` is required
- `emissions_reports` array is required and must contain at least one report
- Each emissions report must have a valid `schema_version`

### Additional Properties
- Root level: No additional properties allowed (`additionalProperties: false`)
- Organisation level: No additional properties allowed (`additionalProperties: false`)
- Emissions reports: Additional properties allowed (`additionalProperties: true`) to accommodate different schema versions


## Example Document

```json
{
  "schema_version": "0.1.1",
  "organisation": {
    "organisation_name": "Example Corp",
    "description": "Software consultancy and product development company",
    "open_corporates_url": "https://opencorporates.com/companies/gb/12345678",
    "registered_country": "England"
  },
  "emissions_reports": [
    {
      "schema_version": "0.0.2",
      "reporting_period": {
        "from_date": "2023-01-01",
        "to_date": "2023-12-31"
      },
      "verification": "self reported",
      "tech_carbon_standard": {
        "schema_version": "0.0.2",
        "upstream_emissions": {
          "employee_hardware": {
            "emissions": 55000,
            "notes": "Embodied carbon of purchased laptops and monitors"
          }
        },
        "direct_emissions": {
          "onsite_employee_hardware": {
            "emissions": 5000,
            "notes": "Office electricity consumption for employee devices",
            "method": "location-based"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Common Validation Errors

1. **Missing schema_version**: Ensure the root level has `"schema_version": "0.1.1"`
2. **Missing organisation_name**: The organisation object must include `organisation_name`
3. **Empty emissions_reports**: At least one emissions report is required
4. **Invalid URI format**: `open_corporates_url` must be a valid URI if provided
