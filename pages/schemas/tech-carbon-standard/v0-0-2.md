# Tech Carbon Standard Schema v0.0.2

The Tech Carbon Standard Schema defines the specific structure for technology carbon emissions data, organised into four main categories that cover the complete technology lifecycle. This schema ensures consistent reporting of technology-related carbon emissions across organisations.

## Schema Overview

**Schema Information**:
- **Schema ID**: [`https://techcarbonstandard.org/schemas/tech_carbon_standard/v0.0.2.json`](/schemas/tech_carbon_standard/v0.0.2.json)
- **Version**: `0.0.2`
- **Parent Schema**: Referenced by Emissions Report Schema
- **Emission Units**: All emissions must be reported in **kgCO2e**

**Key Features**:
- **Four Emissions Categories**: Upstream, direct, indirect, and downstream emissions
- **Consistent Measurement**: All emissions reported in **kgCO2e** for comparability
- **Flexible Reporting**: All categories and sub-categories are optional
- **Methodology Documentation**: Notes fields for calculation approaches
- **GHG Protocol Compliance**: Scope 2 emissions include method specification

### Schema Changelog

**v0.0.2 (current):**
- Added `downstream_infrastructure` category to downstream emissions for infrastructure deployed by customers as a result of using the organisation's products or services.

**v0.0.1:**
- [Tech Carbon Standard v0.0.1](/schemas/tech-carbon-standard/v0-0-1)

## Emission Object Structures

### Standard Emissions

Most emission categories use this structure:

```json
{
  "emissions": 1000,
  "notes": "Description of calculation methodology"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| emissions | number | Yes | Carbon emissions in kgCO2e (minimum: 0) |
| notes | string | No | Notes on calculation methodology or data sources |

### Scope 2 Emissions

Direct operational emissions include an additional method field for GHG Protocol compliance:

```json
{
  "emissions": 1000,
  "notes": "Electricity consumption calculated using grid carbon intensity",
  "method": "location-based"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| emissions | number | Yes | Carbon emissions in kgCO2e (minimum: 0) |
| notes | string | No | Notes on calculation methodology or data sources |
| method | string (enum) | No | "location-based", "market-based", "mixed-methods", or "other" |

**GHG Protocol Scope 2 Methods**:
- **location-based**: Uses grid average emission factors for electricity consumption
- **market-based**: Uses emission factors from contractual arrangements (e.g., renewable energy certificates)
- **mixed-methods**: Combination of location-based and market-based approaches
- **other**: Alternative methodology (should be explained in notes)

## Emissions Categories

### 1. Upstream Emissions

Embodied carbon in hardware and carbon impact of software development:

```json
"upstream_emissions": {
  "software": {
    "emissions": 0,
    "notes": "Emissions associated with developing and delivering off-the-shelf and open-source software installed on the organisation's systems."
  },
  "employee_hardware": {
    "emissions": 55000,
    "notes": "Embodied carbon emissions associated with hardware devices owned by an organisation, including emissions from the manufacture, transportation, installation, maintenance, and end-of-life of a device."
  },
  "network_hardware": {
    "emissions": 1000,
    "notes": "When considering the upstream emissions of a network, consider the embodied carbon of any networking devices that are owned by the organisation."
  },
  "server_hardware": {
    "emissions": 0,
    "notes": "Servers, storage systems, and data centre infrastructure installed on-premise."
  }
}
```

| Category | Description | Typical Calculation |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| software | Emissions from software development and delivery | Development team energy × time × emission factors |
| employee_hardware | Embodied carbon in end-user devices | Device count × embodied carbon per device |

| Missing emissions field | Emission object without emissions | Add required `emissions` field to all emission objects |
| Wrong schema version | Incorrect version string | Use exactly `"0.0.2"` |
| Additional properties | Extra fields in emission objects | Remove any fields not defined in the schema |

## Technical Reference

### Schema Definitions

The schema uses two main definitions for emission objects:

**Standard Emissions** (`emissions_def`):
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "emissions": { "type": "number", "minimum": 0 },
    "notes": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["emissions"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Scope 2 Emissions** (`scope_2_emissions_def`):
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "emissions": { "type": "number", "minimum": 0 },
    "notes": { "type": "string" },
    "method": { "enum": ["location-based", "market-based", "mixed-methods", "other"] }
  },
  "required": ["emissions"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

### JSON Schema Features

- **$defs**: Reusable emission object definitions
- **$ref**: References to shared definitions
- **enum**: Constrained values for methods and schema versions
- **minimum**: Validation ensuring non-negative emissions
- **additionalProperties: false**: Strict schema compliance
