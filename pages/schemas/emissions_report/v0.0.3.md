# Emissions Report Schema v0.0.3

The Emissions Report Schema defines the structure for individual emissions reports within the Technology Carbon Standard, including reporting periods, verification status, disclosures, and the technology carbon standard emissions data.

## Purpose

The Emissions Report Schema provides:

- **Temporal Context**: Defines clear reporting periods for emissions data
- **Verification Framework**: Captures verification status and auditor information
- **Transparency**: Links to relevant disclosure documents and methodologies
- **Data Structure**: Contains the actual technology carbon emissions organised by TCS categories
- **Flexibility**: Allows reporting units to represent different organisational scopes

## Schema Information

- **Schema ID**: [`https://techcarbonstandard.org/schemas/emissions_report/v0.0.3.json`](/schemas/emissions_report/v0.0.3.json)
- **Version**: `0.0.3`
- **Parent Schema**: Referenced by Reporting Organisation Schema
- **Child Schemas**: References Tech Carbon Standard schemas

### Schema Changelog

**v0.0.3 (current):**
- Updating support for the [Tech Carbon Standard Schema v0.1.0](/schemas/tech-carbon-standard/v0-1-0).

**v0.0.2:**
[Emission Report v0.0.2](/schemas/emissions-report/v0-0-2)

```json
"tech_carbon_standard": {
  "schema_version": "0.1.0",
  "upstream_emissions": { /* ... */ },
  "direct_emissions": { /* ... */ },
  "indirect_emissions": { /* ... */ },

## Best Practices

### Reporting Periods
- Use consistent reporting periods across years for comparability
- Align with financial reporting periods where possible
- Document any changes in reporting period boundaries

### Verification
- Consider independent verification for public-facing reports
- Document verification scope and methodology
- Ensure auditor has relevant carbon accounting expertise

### Disclosures
- Link to publicly accessible documents
- Include direct links to specific sections when documents are large
- Update URLs if document locations change

### Reporting Units
- Be consistent with reporting unit definitions over time
- Document reporting unit boundaries and scope
- Consider organisational changes that might affect unit definitions

## Common Validation Errors

1. **Invalid date format**: Dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
2. **Missing auditor_link**: Required when verification is "independently verified"
3. **Invalid doc_type**: Must be exactly "report", "methodology", or "other"
4. **Invalid URI format**: URLs must be properly formatted URIs
5. **Missing tech_carbon_standard**: This object is required for all emissions reports
