# Emissions Report Schema v0.0.1

The Emissions Report Schema defines the structure for individual emissions reports within the Technology Carbon Standard, including reporting periods, verification status, disclosures, and the technology carbon standard emissions data.

## Purpose

The Emissions Report Schema provides:

- **Temporal Context**: Defines clear reporting periods for emissions data
- **Verification Framework**: Captures verification status and auditor information
- **Transparency**: Links to relevant disclosure documents and methodologies
- **Data Structure**: Contains the actual technology carbon emissions organised by TCS categories
- **Flexibility**: Allows reporting units to represent different organisational scopes

## Schema Information

- **Schema ID**: [`https://techcarbonstandard.org/schemas/emissions_report/v0.0.1.json`](/schemas/emissions_report/v0.0.1.json)
- **Version**: `0.0.1`
- **Parent Schema**: Referenced by Reporting Organisation Schema
- **Child Schemas**: References Tech Carbon Standard schemas

## Schema Structure

```json
{
  "schema_version": "0.0.1",
  "reporting_unit": "UK Operations",
  "reporting_period": {
    "from_date": "2023-01-01",
    "to_date": "2023-12-31"
  },
  "verification": "independently verified",
  "auditor_link": "https://example-auditor.com/",
  "disclosures": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/sustainability-report.pdf",
      "doc_type": "report",
      "description": "Annual sustainability report"
    }
  ],
  "tech_carbon_standard": {
    "schema_version": "0.0.1",
    // TCS emissions data
  }
}
```

## Core Fields

### Schema Version (required)

Specifies the version of the Emissions Report Schema being used:

```json
"schema_version": "0.0.1"
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| schema_version | string (enum) | Yes | Must be "0.0.1" for this schema version |

### Reporting Unit (optional)

Identifies the specific organisational unit for this emissions report:

```json
"reporting_unit": "UK Operations"
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| reporting_unit | string | No | Sub-organisation group, region, or reporting entity |

**Use Cases for Reporting Units**:
- Geographic divisions (e.g., "North America", "EMEA")
- Business units (e.g., "Software Division", "Consulting Services")
- Legal entities within a corporate group

| doc_type | string (enum) | Yes | Must be "report", "methodology", or "other" |
| description | string | No | Brief description of the disclosure content |

**Document Types**:
- `"report"`: Sustainability reports, annual reports, CSR documents
- `"methodology"`: Carbon calculation methodologies, technical documentation
- `"other"`: Any other relevant disclosure documents

### Tech Carbon Standard (required)

Contains the actual emissions data structured according to TCS categories:

```json
"tech_carbon_standard": {
  "schema_version": "0.0.1",
  "upstream_emissions": { /* ... */ },
  "direct_emissions": { /* ... */ },
  "indirect_emissions": { /* ... */ },
  "downstream_emissions": { /* ... */ }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| schema_version | string (enum) | Yes | Version of the Tech Carbon Standard schema |

The `tech_carbon_standard` object is validated against the specified Tech Carbon Standard schema version. Currently supported:
- `"0.0.1"` - Initial TCS schema with four emissions categories

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields
- `schema_version` must be `"0.0.1"`
- `reporting_period` object with both `from_date` and `to_date`
- `verification` must be either `"self reported"` or `"independently verified"`
- `tech_carbon_standard` object with valid `schema_version`

### Conditional Requirements
- `auditor_link` is required when `verification` equals `"independently verified"`

### Additional Properties
- Root level: No additional properties allowed (`additionalProperties: false`)
- Disclosure objects: No additional properties allowed
- Tech Carbon Standard: Additional properties allowed to accommodate different schema versions

}
```

## Best Practices

### Reporting Periods
- Use consistent reporting periods across years for comparability
- Align with financial reporting periods where possible
- Document any changes in reporting period boundaries

### Verification
- Consider independent verification for public-facing reports
- Document verification scope and methodology
- Ensure auditor has relevant carbon accounting expertise

### Disclosures
- Link to publicly accessible documents
- Include direct links to specific sections when documents are large
- Update URLs if document locations change

### Reporting Units
- Be consistent with reporting unit definitions over time
- Document reporting unit boundaries and scope
- Consider organisational changes that might affect unit definitions

## Common Validation Errors

1. **Invalid date format**: Dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
2. **Missing auditor_link**: Required when verification is "independently verified"
3. **Invalid doc_type**: Must be exactly "report", "methodology", or "other"
4. **Invalid URI format**: URLs must be properly formatted URIs
5. **Missing tech_carbon_standard**: This object is required for all emissions reports
