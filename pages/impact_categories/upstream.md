# Upstream Emissions

Upstream emissions (Category U) refer to the [embodied carbon](/resources/glossary#embodied-carbon) emissions of hardware purchased by an organisation and the carbon emissions of the development and distribution of installed software used by the organisation.

Evaluating both carbon emissions and water consumption to understand upstream emissions allows organisations to comprehensively assess the environmental impact of their assets and supply chains. It enables the development of strategies to reduce the carbon and water footprint of materials and processes, promoting sustainable procurement practices and circular economy principles.

Upstream emissions are related to GHG Protocol Scope 3.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Software" level=2 %}

Emissions associated with developing and delivering off-the-shelf and open-source software installed on the organisation's systems. Includes emissions related to:

- Energy consumed and hardware used during programming, testing and releasing new software versions.
- Packaging and digital distribution of software over the internet.
- Product support services for troubleshooting and guiding customers.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Hardware" level=2 %}

Embodied carbon emissions and water consumption associated with hardware devices owned by an organisation, including emissions from the manufacture, transportation, installation, maintenance, and end-of-life of a device.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Employee Hardware" level=3 %} 

Laptops, desktops, mobiles, printers, and peripherals used by employees. 

To accurately assess their emissions, the whole supply chain must be examined, from raw material extraction to manufacturing. For example, semiconductor production relies on energy-intensive techniques, contributing substantially to carbon emissions.

The production of these electronic devices is also extremely water-intensive. Their water footprint stems from the virtual water embedded in every stage of global manufacturing, from mining precious metals and producing synthetic chemicals for glue and plastic, to assembling and packaging.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Networking Hardware" level=3 %} 

When considering the upstream emissions of a network, consider the embodied carbon and water of any networking devices that are owned by the organisation. These include, but are not limited to:
- routers
- switches
- bridges
- Wi-Fi access points
- firewalls
- modems
- hubs
- repeaters
- cables

Ideally, data sheets from the manufacturer should be used to gather this data.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Data Centre and Server Hardware" level=3 %} 

Servers, storage systems, and data centre infrastructure installed on-premise.

Assessing the water footprint of data centres requires examining three key areas:
- Onsite water: used to power and cool the IT infrastructure 
- Embodied water: involved in server design and manufacture 
- Offsite water: required to generate electricity
While renewable sources generate fewer carbon emissions, they may need propertionally larger amounts of water to generate electricity. This trade-off highlights the need to co-optimise carbon and water footprints. 
The rapid expansion of AI workloads in data centres intensifies this challenge, due to their growing reliance on water-intensive cooling technologies to meet computing demands.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Content" level=2 %}

Embodied carbon emissions associated with producing, distributing and storing digital content.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Foundation Models" level=3 %} 

AI workloads rely on specialised hardware and AI accelerators to perform complex computations at high speed. 
When assessing the upstream emissions of foundation models, it's essential to account for the embodied carbon and water of the IT infrastructure involved in their training, deployment and with inference. This includes the carbon footprint and water consumption associated with manufacturing specialised hardware and constructing and operating AI data centres. Key components include, but are not limited to:
- High-Performance Computing systems (HPC)
- Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) 
- Central Processing Units (CPUs) 
- Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) 
- Memory (RAM) 
- Storage  
- Networking equipment
- Advanced cooling and power supply 
- Distributed computing 

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Content and Data" level=3 %} 

When considering the upstream emissions of content and data, whether text, image, audio or video used as a commodity by the organisation, evaluate emissions that relate to: 

- Content production
    * Energy used to produce content, including pre-production (such as research and planning), filming, recording and editing involved.
- Processing
    * Data processing and AI/ML workflows, if content is algorithmically recommended, auto-captioned or translated for example.
- Storage
    * Energy consumption and hardware required for storing content and data.
- Distribution
    * Digital distribution of content over the internet.     
    * Network infrastructure such as content delivery networks (CDNs).
- Archiving
    * Energy used to migrate, compress, and maintain historical content and datasets.
