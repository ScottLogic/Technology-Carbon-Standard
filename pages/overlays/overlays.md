# Overlays 

In order to make the standard a bit more concrete and show how it can apply to different people and different domains, the overlay section has projections of particular people and technical domains onto the standard. For example, a dev-ops engineer can do to influence carbon emissions or how data systems (e.g. ETL jobs, databases and object storage) map into the standard's categories.
