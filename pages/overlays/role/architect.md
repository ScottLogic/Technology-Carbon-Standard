# Architect

As an architect you can exert significant influence on a company's tech carbon emissions. You might be a technical/solutions/enterprise/other architect and although the scope may vary across architecture roles there's many common activities where you can have a positive impact on carbon emissions including: 

 1. Setting the tech strategy
 2. Promoting best practice
 3. Leading technical selection, e.g. of a cloud vendor or a SaaS product
 4. Designing architecture (from enterprise to technical) 
 5. Setting NFRs

The first couple are high level activities that can vary from setting the cloud vs on-prem strategy through to promoting technical principles around resilience or serverless vs container. 

The remaining 3 are actually all about NFRs to some degree. Tech selection will be done against a set of functional and non-functional requirements and architecture design choices will be done against a set of NFRs, e.g. to promote availability or low cost. Let's see then how strategy and setting NFRs can be used to influence low carbon. 

## Setting strategy and best practice

The diagram below gives takes the standard and overlays on the categories some examples of how you might influence them:

We'll now provide a bit more detail on each of these:
### Upstream
#### Commercial
All software creation comes with a cost and the first thing you might decide to do is to trade off open source and COTS software against in-house. Some of the in-house software carbon costs are out of the scope in this standard because they are non-technology items like buildings and transport for employees. Still you may wish to increase your emissions within the standard by using existing software rather than creating your own as existing software is sharing the carbon impact across many orgs, not just yours. 

You may also wish to prefer vendors who report on their emissions and follow sustainability best practices in order to push software and machine learning model creators to be more sustainable. e.g. training models with renewable electricity. 

#### Hardware Manufacture, Transport and Installation
Not all architects will get involved in hardware selection - servers and network equipment may fall under data centre architects for example. Where you do though there's a few common themes:
 * Setting renewal cycles, i.e. how often we should replace hardware
    * By setting a target or saying we favour hardware with the longest support and expected lifetime we reduce the frequency of refresh and thus reduce embodied carbon
 * Recycling
 * Embodied carbon target
