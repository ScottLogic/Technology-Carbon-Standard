# Architect

As an architect you are able to have significant influence on a company's tech carbon emissions. You mgiht be a technical or solutions or enterprise architect and although the scope may vary across arcitect roles there's many common activities where you can have a positive impact on carbon emissions: 

 1. Setting the tech strategy
 2. Promoting best practice
 3. Leading technical selection, e.g. of a cloud vendor or a SaaS product
 4. Designing architecture (from enterprise to technical) 
 5. Setting NFRs

The first couple are high level activities that can vary from setting the cloud vs on-prem strategy through to promoting technical principles around resilience or serverless vs container. 

The remaining 3 are actually all about NFRs to some degree. Tech selection will be done against a set of functional and non-functional requirements and architecture design choices will be done against a set of NFRs, e.g. to promote availability or low cost. Let's see then how strategy and setting NFRs can be used to influence low carbon.
