# Detailed Estimation of Employee Hardware (Category U)

After producing the "beer mat" estimates for GWF's technology we decided to focus on producing some more detailed estimates for the upstream employee hardware. There were a number of reasons for this focus:

1. The carbon emissions of the employee hardware makes up such a large percentage of GWF's overall carbon footprint meant it was simply too large to ignore.
1. We knew that the "beer mat" estimates didn't take into any account for the use of refurbished equipment. Using refrubished equipment is a conscious decision by employees of Green Web Foundation, not only for cost saving, but the environmental benefit of extending the life of hardware for as long as posisble.

## Information Gathering

The first steps to producing a more accurate carbon emissions estimate is to gather specific details of the hardware such as manufacturer and model of the equipment. Where possible we gathered product carbon footprint [(PCF)](/glossary#product-carbon-footprint-pcf) data sheets. Some manufacturers provide excellent resources for finding this data on their products. Some manufacturers are very poor. Where this was the case, we would find an approximatly equivalent product to use instead (these are indicated in the tables below).

When new equipment is purchased by an organisation, the entire embodied carbon is accounted for by that organisation. We tried to understand what that means for an organisation that acquires a refreshed (reused, refurbished, remanufactured) product, and how that would be accounted. After exploring some ideas and methods we reached out to talk with [Circularity First](https://circularity-first.com/). 

Circularity First have extensive research and experience in refreshed and remanufactured products. They shared with us that purchasing a remanufactured product can save ~60% of the carbon emissions compared to buying the product new. A "remanufactured" product is deconstructed, fully checked and rebuilt using new or re-used replacement parts back to the original manufacturers specification and often comes with an original manufacturers warranty.

For "reburbished" devices, this process is less intensive. Devices are simply cleaned, diagnosed and tested for defects and only replace damaged components where neccessary for functional operation. This process is harder to estimate the embodied carbon, and can vary between 85-95% saving of carbon emissions. These emissions would include transport (to and from the place of refurbishment), packaging and the testing and diagnosis process, plus (if) any replacement parts. 

As most of GWF's devices are refurbished, and we agreed to use a conservative estimate of 85% carbon emissions saving we apply 15% of the original device's embodied carbon to GWF. One device was simply re-used, acquired and repurposed for GWF and so this has no further embodied carbon to account for.

With the specific understanding that most of the equipment is BYOD, it was useful to gather more detail about how many days per (working (5)) week the device is used for GWF and attribute those working days to GWF.

Below, the table compiles all of this data and produces the embodied carbon attributable to GWF.
