# Overview


In this section, we set the scene for this project. 

## Results summary

<span style="color: red;">Diagram and short summary of key insights here<span>

<span style="color: coral;">HANNAH: please feel free to move and expand on this as you need to. Hopefully, these numbers are pretty solid now... (?!) and I promise to create a new treemap that looks better than the one below with more detail.<span>

## Context - why do this project?

At the beginning of 2024, Green Web Foundation (GWF) set a goal to estimate their organisation's carbon emissions for the first time. Given the GWF team's knowledge of estimating digital emissions, the team decided to split out estimating the emissions from their digital estate from the rest of the business.

Also around the start of 2024, the first version of the open-source [Technology Carbon Standard](https://www.techcarbonstandard.org/) (TCS) was launched by Scott Logic.

As long-term advocates for the benefits of open-source, GWF and Scott Logic agreed to partner up and form this project. The project set out to use the TCS framework to estimate GWF's digital estate, fully documenting their decisions, methodology and learning points as they went so others could learn from their experience. This project write-up is the result of this collaboration.
