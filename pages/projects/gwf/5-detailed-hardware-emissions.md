# Detailed Estimation of Employee Hardware (Category U)

After producing the "beer mat" estimates for GWF's technology we decided to focus on producing some more detailed estimates for the upstream employee hardware. There were a number of reasons for this focus:

1. The carbon emissions of the employee hardware makes up such a large percentage of GWF's overall carbon footprint meant it was simply too large to ignore.
1. We knew that the "beer mat" estimates didn't take into any account for the use of refurbished equipment. Using refrubished equipment is a conscious decision by employees of Green Web Foundation, not only for cost saving, but the environmental benefit of extending the life of hardware for as long as posisble.

## Information Gathering

The first steps to producing a more accurate carbon emissions estimate is to gather specific details of the hardware such as manufacturer and model of the equipment. Where possible we gathered product carbon footprint [PCF](/glossary#product-carbon-footprint-pcf) data sheets. With the specific understanding that most of the equipment is BYOD, it was useful to gather more detail about how much the device is used for GWF. Also, as most of the equipment is refurbished equipment, so more information was gathered and further research undertaken to establish a method for calculating the embodied carbon of these devices.
