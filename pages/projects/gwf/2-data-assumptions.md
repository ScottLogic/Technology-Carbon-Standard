# Assumptions and Decisions

## Units

For this project of mapping the GWF technology estate using TCS, we calculate the final figures to **kgCO2e/year**. 

We typically use **kW** and **kWhs** when quoting energy use and consumption. 

Carbon intensity is typically quoted in **gCO2e/kWh**.

We've chosen to round calcuation outputs when appropriate, which may lead to some rounding errors and very minor variation in the results.

## Regional Carbon Intensity

The GWF team are a remote team, positioned around the world. We use the regional electricity gridâ€™s carbon intensity to calculate the operational carbon emissions. The following regional carbon intensities are used:
- Germany: 363.982gCO2e/kWh
- Netherlands: 386.189gCO2e/kWh
- Taiwan: 565.629gCO2e/kWh
- UK: 268.255gCO2e/kWh
- Global: 490gCO2e/kWh
- Europe: 328gCO2e/kWh

These values were obtained from the GWF [Grid Intensity CLI tool](https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/grid-intensity-cli/overview/) and the Tech Carbon Standard (based on Ember Data Explorer).
