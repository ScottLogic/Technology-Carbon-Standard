# Architecture Views

## The role
As an architect you can exert significant influence on a company's tech carbon emissions. You might be a technical/solutions/enterprise/other architect and although the scope of responsibility can vary across roles, there are many activities common to all where you can make a difference to carbon emissions including:

- Setting the tech strategy
    - e.g. cloud vs on-prem, build vs buy
- Promoting best practice and setting tech principles
    - e.g. principles around resilience, data retention etc
- Leading technical selection, e.g. of a cloud vendor or a SaaS product
- Architecture Design (from enterprise to technical)
- Setting non-functional requirements (NFRs)

The first couple are about strategy and the other 3 about NFRs - tech selection and solution design are about weighing up options against the non functionals. Therefore 2 views are provided to cover these 2 areas:
