# Operational Carbon Emissions 

[Operational carbon](/glossary#operational-carbon), also known as carbon emissions from use or usage emissions, refers to the [greenhouse gas (GHG)](/glossary#greenhouse-gases) emissions associated with the actual operation and use of a device or product over its lifetime. Operational carbon emissions can be categorised into direct and indirect emissions. Direct emissions are a result of the organisationâ€™s direct consumption of grid-supplied electricity (Category O) or combustion of fossil fuels like diesel or natural gas for owned power generators (Category G). The organisation can directly measure and account for emissions from owned assets. Indirect emissions are attributable to external hardware or service solutions not owned or controlled by the organisations, such as emissions from cloud computing services, software or managed IT services from third-party technology providers, making it difficult to directly quantify these emissions. Operational carbon excludes emissions from the manufacturing, transportation, maintenance, consumables/replacements or end-of-life disposal phases, which instead fall under the [embodied carbon footprint](embodied). Factors influencing operational carbon impact include the device's energy efficiency, usage patterns, life span and the carbon intensity of the energy grid powering it. 

The ICT sector's electricity consumption was estimated at 1,183 TWh in 2022, accounting for 4.7 percent of the world's total electricity use in 2021[^worldbank]. With the accelerating pace of digitalisation and the increasing reliance on ICT services and infrastructure, the energy demands of the sector are projected to rise further in the coming years. Minimising operational carbon through efficiency improvements and cleaner energy sources is therefore crucial, in conjunction with reducing embodied emissions, to comprehensively reduce the greenhouse gas impact of a product or device across its complete life cycle.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="A high level approach to estimation" level=3 %}

The following approach provides a high-level estimation of the direct operational emissions resulting from an organization's owned hardware assets.

At a high level, the energy consumption of a device can be estimated using the following formula:

$$ E = P \times t $$

Where
- E is energy consumption (kWh).
- P is average power draw (kW).
- t is time (hours).

The average power draw (P) can be obtained from industry averages, manufacturer data, or actual readings, in increasing order of precision but also complexity. Organizations should balance the need for precision with practical considerations when selecting the source for P, keeping in mind the goal of effectively directing technology optimisation efforts.

Estimated energy consumption can be combined with a [carbon intensity](/glossary#carbon-intensity) factor to estimate operational emissions using the following formula:

$$ O = E \times I $$

Where
- O is operational emissions (kg CO2e).
- E is energy consumption (kWh).
- I is carbon intensity (kg CO2e per kWh).

The per device estimates can be scaled up to give a total estimate of the operational emissions across an organization's estate **per hardware model and location**. Refer to [estate emissions](estate) for information on obtaining asset counts. Combined, the formula for estimating operational emissions across the estate becomes:

$$ O_T = N \times O $$

Where
- O<sub>T</sub> is the total operational emissions across the estate (kg CO2e).
- N is the number of devices of a particular hardware model operating in a particular location.
- O is the operational emissions for a single device (kg CO2e), estimated as above.

For example, a typical laptop may draw 30W. Assuming an employee's laptop runs for 8 hours a day over a working year (approximately 220 days), the annual energy consumption can be estimated as 0.03kW * 8 * 220 = 52.8 kWh per year. If the employee works in Europe, with an average carbon intensity factor of 0.328 kg CO2e per kWh (2022), the estimated operational emissions from this device would be 52.8 * 0.328 = 17.3 kg CO2e per year. Scaling this up, if there are 50 employees using this laptop model in Europe, the total operational emissions across the estate for this device in this location would be approximately 17.3 * 50 = 866 kg CO2e.

The table below shows an example of aggregating emissions across different employee device types and locations using the high level approach above assuming business usage.

| Device | Model | Location | Device Count | Average Power (kW) | Estimated Device Energy Consumption (kWh/yr) |Estimated Total Energy Consumption (kWh/yr) | Carbon Intensity (kg CO2e/kWh) | Estimated Operational Emissions (kg CO2e/yr) |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Laptop  | Dell XPS 13 9310 | Europe | 500 | 0.015[^dellxps] | 26.4| 13,200 | 0.328 |4,330|
| Laptop  | Dell XPS 13 9310 | USA    | 300 | 0.015 | 26.4|7,920 | 0.410 |3,247|
| Monitor | HP Z24s | Europe | 1000 | 0.06[^hpz24s] | 105.6 |105,600 | 0.328 |34,637|
| **Total** ||||||**126,720**|| **42,214** |

Where specific device models or usage locations are unknown, [average figures](see next section) for the device category as a whole can be used instead. This sacrifices precision for practicality but maintains a view to direct technology optimisation efforts.

While the above approach relies on key assumptions and does not account for the variability in device usage patterns, it is a useful starting point for identifying emissions improvement opportunities within an organization's technology footprint. Continued refinement of this baseline estimate through more granular monitoring and profiling of actual usage would be required to enable rollout of more targeted carbon reduction initiatives.

This considers the energy consumed by computers (desktops, laptops), monitors, printers and other devices used by employees. Energy consumption will differ between devices due to varying power demands and employee usage patterns. Typically, a smartphone draws less power than a laptop and a laptop draws less power than a desktop, as illustrated in the table below.

Power range and average power of devices, data compiled from Dimpact [^dimpact], Scope3 [^scope3] and Fershad Irani [^fershad] and our own device energy use research:

| Device             | Power Range (W)    | Average Power (W)  |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Desktop            | 72 - 100           | 72.3               |
| Laptop             | 15 - 30            | 17.1               |
| Tablet             | 3 - 5.5            | 3                  |
| Smartphone         | 0.77 - 2           | 1                  |
| Monitor            | 17 - 30            | 30                 |
| Television         | 40 - 120           | 74                 |

Such power figures can be used in high level approximations for annual energy consumption and subsequently annual operational emissions.

This concerns the energy consumed by on-premise servers. Servers can be major contributors to an organisation's carbon footprint due to their high energy usage. Server hardware can be highly customisable resulting in large variances in power demands.  

Manufacturer data or benchmarking tools can provide information on the typical power draw of different server hardware. One such tool is the [SPECpower benchmark](https://www.spec.org/power_ssj2008/) which evaluates the power and performance characteristics of servers, providing average power draw figures under varying levels of load. Such power figures can be used in high level approximations for annual energy consumption and subsequently annual operational emissions. 

Here is an example of a [SPECpower benchmark summary](https://www.spec.org/power_ssj2008/results/res2019q2/power_ssj2008-20190311-00882.html) for a HPE ProLiant DL580 Gen10 server:

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Using emissions data provided by manufacturers" level=3 %}

Many manufacturers choose to provide [life cycle emissions data](../lifecycle#life-cycle-emissions-data) such as information relating to the [Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)](/glossary#product-carbon-footprint-pcf) of a product. A PCF provides an estimate of the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with a product across its entire life cycle, including the proportional allocation of emissions to each distinct life cycle stage. PCF data can be used to derive direct operational emissions resulting from an organization's owned hardware assets.

Operational carbon can vary widely between different device types, as illustrated below:

![operational-carbon](/assets/images/operational-carbon.png)

*Source: Dell Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) documents for an example model of Laptop[^laptop], Desktop[^desktop], Monitor[^monitor] and Server[^server].*

Servers can be associated with high operational emissions compared to employee or end-user devices like laptops or smartphones. This is largely due to higher power consumption associated with more powerful processors, large amounts of RAM, and multiple hard drives to store and process data, as well as more continuous usage patterns.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Typical Energy Consumption (TEC)" level=3 %}

When providing PCF data, manufacturers often include assumptions and inputs used in the methodology. With regards to operational emissions, one such assumption to note is the [Typical Energy Consumption (TEC)](/glossary#typical-energy-consumption-tec) figure. TEC is an estimate of a device's expected annual energy consumption based on standard usage patterns. For devices like desktops, laptops, and smartphones, TEC is based on standard household usage. For servers, TEC assumes 24/7 operation. This can be used in place of the estimated annual energy consumption figure approximated through the high-level approach discussed earlier. 

It's important to note that for employee devices, TEC may underestimate energy consumption compared to actual business usage patterns, where devices are typically used for longer durations and more intensive workloads. Therefore, using TEC in subsequent estimations of emissions arising from business operations could result in lower emissions estimates than expected. 

To ensure accurate and comparable emissions estimates across all hardware assets, it is recommended to cross-reference TEC values and clarify the assumptions made by manufacturers. Using consistent data sources and transparency over methodology is crucial.

Consider the [PCF for a Dell XPS 13 9310 Laptop](https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/laptops-and-2-in-1s/technical-support/xps-13-9310.pdf). This is the same model as used in the example in [embodied emissions](embodied) - read there for further detail on the life cycle emissions breakdown. 

Dell estimates the total carbon footprint of this laptop to be approximately 322 kg CO2e over its 4-year life time.

Of this, 86.1% (277 kg CO2e) is attributed to embodied emissions (manufacturing, transportation, and end-of-life), while 13.9% (45 kg CO2e) is attributed to operational emissions.

Amortizing the operational emissions over the expected 4-year life span, the annual operational emissions can be allocated as approximately 11 kg CO2e per year.

However, the high-level approach discussed earlier, which estimates annual energy consumption based on power draw and usage patterns, yields a different result. Assuming the laptop runs for 8 hours per day (typical business usage), the estimated annual energy consumption is 26.4 kWh. Dell's PCF assumes Europe as usage location - using an average carbon intensity factor for Europe (0.328 kg CO2e/kWh in 2022), this translates to approximately 8.66 kg CO2e of annual operational emissions per device.

Additionally, the Dell PCF documentation states a Typical Energy Consumption (TEC) of 21.43 kWh per year for this laptop model. This is lower than above as would be expected due to assuming standard household usage. Using this TEC figure in the high-level approach in the same way as above would result in an annual operational emissions estimate of approximately 7 kg CO2e per device.

This discrepancy between the different estimation approaches and the PCF data highlights the impact of using different assumptions and data sources when estimating operational emissions. It underscores the importance of cross-referencing values and clarifying assumptions made by manufacturers to ensure accurate and consistent emissions reporting.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Server" level=3 %}

Consider the [PCF for a HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 server](https://www.hpe.com/psnow/doc/a50004545enw). This is the same model as used in the example in [embodied emissions](embodied) - read there for further detail on the life cycle emissions breakdown. 

The total carbon footprint varies significantly, ranging from approximately 2,410 kg CO2e for a base server operating in Europe to approximately 13,402 kg CO2e for a performance server operating in Japan.

In contrast to employee and end-user devices such as laptops or smartphones, usage (operational emissions) accounts for the largest share of a server's total life cycle emissions. For this server, operational emissions range from 56.7% for a base server operating in Europe to 84.6% for a performance server operating in Japan. 

The variation in operational emissions can be attributed to several factors:
1. Utilization rates: The PCF assumes a 30% utilization rate, which may differ from actual organizational usage patterns.
2. Carbon intensity of electricity: The carbon intensity of the electricity grid at the operating location significantly impacts the emissions. Typically, carbon intensity is lower in Europe compared to Asia, contributing to the smaller proportion of usage emissions for servers operating in Europe versus Japan.
3. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE): The PCF incorporates PUE data from industry sources to account for the energy consumption of supporting infrastructure (cooling, power distribution, etc.) in data centers.

Consider a mainstream server operating in the United States. The total product carbon footprint is approximately 5,657 kg CO2e. 

Of this, 69.5% (3,932 kg CO2e) is attributed to operational emissions.

Amortizing the operational emissions over the expected 4-year life span, the annual operational emissions can be allocated as approximately 983 kg CO2e per year.

The PCF assumes an annual Typical Energy Consumption (TEC) value of 1,605 kWh for this server model, based on modeling using the HPE Power Advisor tool and assuming 30% utilization, 24/7 operation, and PUE values from industry sources.

In the PCF documentation, HPE actually advises on how to customise use stage or operational emissions by considering:
- grid emissions intensity: Use credible sources (e.g., electric providers, EPA eGRID, EEA, or aggregation services like Ember-Climate) to obtain location-specific grid emissions intensity values (grams of CO2e per kWh).
- Server power: Directly read server power (kW) using the HPE iLO and Redfish API or model it using the HPE Power Advisor tool by adjusting the utilization to match the average workload.
- Usage duration: Multiply the product lifetime (years) by 365 days and 24 hours, or customize the days and hours to match specific usage patterns.
- Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE): Optionally include PUE based on the scope of the LCA, calculated by dividing the total facility energy by the IT equipment energy.

For example, consider a different utilisation.(research load vs. utilization) For example, at 50% load (more like 75% ?? Teads), the [SPECpower benchmark summary](https://www.spec.org/power_ssj2008/results/res2018q3/power_ssj2008-20180828-00850.html) for a similar HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 server configuration shows an average power draw of 173W, translating to an estimated annual energy consumption of 1,515 kWh (0.173 kW Ã— 365 days Ã— 24 hours), which is roughly similar to the TEC. 

Now consider grid intensity - Using the carbon intensity factor for the USA (0.410 kg CO2e/kWh), this would result in approximately 621 kg CO2e of annual operational emissions.

highlights the impact of using different assumptions and data sources when estimating operational emissions. It underscores the importance of cross-referencing values and clarifying assumptions made by manufacturers to ensure accurate and consistent emissions reporting.
