# Technology Carbon Estimator

**The Technology Carbon Estimator is designed to give a high-level overview of the possible areas of carbon impact within your IT estate.**

The estimations are framed within our proposed model of tech emissions – the [Technology Carbon Standard](/) – designed to help you map out, measure and improve the environmental impacts of your technology.

Scott Logic helps organisations achieve their business sustainability goals by improving their technology sustainability. If you'd like to discuss your technology carbon estimate with us, [please get in touch](https://www.scottlogic.com/contact-us?formId=sales-enquiries).

If you experience any issues using the calculator, you can [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/ScottLogic/sl-tech-carbon-estimator/issues).
