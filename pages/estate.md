# Understanding Estate Emissions

To estimate the total emissions from an organisation's technology estate, it is crucial to understand the scale and composition of the various [Impact Categories](categories).

## Hardware

For hardware devices, this entails determining the quantity of each device type within the organisation's inventory. 

Ideal data sources are configuration management databases (CMDBs) from robust IT asset management processes or platforms such as [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/uk/). In cases where data is incomplete, extrapolation from partial datasets can provide reasonable estimates. These sources may include partially completed asset management records, historic procurement data on devices purchased, employee headcounts per office location, or generic device-to-employee ratios based on job roles.

The accuracy of the underlying data will directly impact the precision of emissions estimates across the entire technology inventory. However, even approximate extrapolated totals can help identify significant emission hotspots. Conducting an inventory-wide emissions assessment enables organisations to pinpoint areas for emission reductions, track performance over time, and work towards minimising the carbon footprint across their entire digital ecosystem.
